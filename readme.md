# ssb-web

This is the main website for Secret Society Blanket, containing author information, a reader, and more. It is built off of [blanket-serv](https://github.com/Secret-Society-Blanket/blanket-serv) which was commissioned specifically for this purpose, but the code is open-source and can be adapted to any scanlation group.


## Building

Building the site uses the same instructions for [blanket-serv](https://github.com/Secret-Society-Blanket/blanket-serv), so they are not included here.

If you want to explore, you can do a quick-start of the site using the command ```docker-compose up -d --build``` which will build and run the site in the background. Make sure to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
